## Notes
- Ensure Python is in your system PATH
- First run may take longer as SpiderFoot initializes its database
- The 5-second timeout allows SpiderFoot to initialize before Chrome opens
- For headless servers, remove or modify the Chrome launch command

## Troubleshooting
If Chrome doesn't open:

Verify Chrome is installed at the default location

Check if SpiderFoot is running by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5001 manually

Ensure no other service is using port 5001

If you get Python errors:

Verify all requirements are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Check Python version (python3 --version)
